Name: Robbie Young

My plan for using Kali is honestly just exploring cyber security; I have dove down the YouTube rabbit hole (very often) and have found myself watching security videos and have heard of Kali beforehand, but never have set it up, so I am looking forward to being able to finally do something with Kali.

My status for the installation is not well, as I have been getting stuck at a website issue when trying to login to download.
